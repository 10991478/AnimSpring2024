Robot Arm:
  - Sketch phase updates:
    - Each joint both swivels and rotates
    - "thumb" is attached to a cylindrical joint that swivels
      - Thumb swivel allows the hand to appear more humanoid if desired
  - Modeling phase updates:
    - Decided to change the attachment position of the upper palm to increase thumb range of movement
      - It used to attach on the sides, now attaches in back
    - The joints bend and swivel points are separate from eachother
