Robot Arm:
  - Sketch phase updates:
    - Each joint both swivels and rotates
    - "thumb" is attached to a cylindrical joint that swivels
      - Thumb swivel allows the hand to appear more humanoid if desired
  - Modeling phase updates:
    - Decided to change the attachment position of the upper palm to increase thumb range of movement
      - It used to attach on the sides, now attaches in back
    - The joints bend and swivel points are separate from eachother
  - UV mapping & texturing phase updates:
    - Biggest issue was with the palm of the model that I had used a bool for and then retopo-ed
      - Found that there was some messed up geometry going on and had to fix it
    - Mostly it went well. I modeled in such a way that there were easy seams throughout the whole model
    - Textured in substance painter and that went well. Used some nice smart materials

Dolphin Character:
  - Modeling phase updates:
    - Modeled in Zbrush and then moved over to Maya
    - Used Zremesher to get a model into maya to set as live surface
      - Zremeshed model is very high poly, but much lower poly than the original
    - Used quad draw to retopo because low poly Zremesher model had too many polys in body and not enough in face
Human Character:
  - Design phase updates:
    - Came up with four different designs for potential characters, all with unique personalities/looks
    - Further refined each design until I was at a point where I was happy with each of them
    - Asked for opinions on my designs from many other people to help me decide which one I should do
    - Ended up deciding on a goblin-looking character because I like the design and it has a lot of potential for expressive animation
    - Created a character sheet for my chosen design to further explore and define the forms of the character in preparation for 3D modeling
